/**
 * Rugenda is a database utility tool that helps you connect and run a query to any database that has a JDBC driver support.
 *
 * Why did we create the tool?
 * + We have had scenarios where needed to query a remote database and all we have is SSH access to the server
 * + We need a tool that can help in the migration of data from one database to another - you have created a new database schema and want to insert records from another database (as long as the table names are the same)
